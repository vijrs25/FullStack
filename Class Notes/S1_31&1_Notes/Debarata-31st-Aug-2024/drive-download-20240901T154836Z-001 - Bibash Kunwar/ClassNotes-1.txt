Class-1, Class-2 - Theory 
Class-3 to Class-8 - Practical
1.5hr - Break 15min - 1.15min of class = 3 hr 
QnA - Class - QnA

Class-1: Theory 
---------------
what? Microsoft SQL Server(Database management software) - SQL (Structured query language)
why?  SQL - It is the very core/ fundamental language in software industry 
how?  weekend batch - 3hr - 24hr live class (1st half - 15min break - 2nd half)

RDBMS(Structured) - MS-SQL Server(70%), Oracle, DB2, mysql, Postgres 
NoSQL(Bigdata/Unstructured) - MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, CouchDB, DocumentDB, AuroraDB

Application Layer: 
User Interface - HTML, CSS
Application layer - c#, java
Database layer - SQL 

Client Server Architecture - Google, Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, YouTube 
OLTP - Online Transaction Protocol 




MS-SQL Server/ Database Server - Server Software 
SSMS/ SQL Server Management Studio - Clint software 
SSMS <--> SQL Server

-- What is client server architecture? 
-- What is data consistency? 

-- Command types:
DQL, DDL, DML, DCL


I want to store student information
StudentDetails
-----------------
S_ID, Name, Age, Contact, Address

file-1:      'My name is Rahul, my age is 20'
file-1-Copy: 'My name is Rahul, my age is 20'


person(ID, Name, Age)
1, Priya, 25
2, Trimala, 26
3, Mahesh, 26


1 --> 25
2 --> 26
3 --> 26

2 --> 26/27

DBMS -- server name
Databases
Tables
Data


-- What is normalization? 
Technique to minimize data duplication and increase logical consistency. 


-- Why to perform normalization? 
Remove redundancy from database tables
Maintain consistency and integrity

-- What is consistency? 
there should not be any data mismatch between different access. 

-- what is integrity? 
If the data is consistent that means the table maintained its integrity.  

anomalies without normalization?
Redundancy, Insert, update, delete anomalies

Person(SSN, Name, Age, Address)
SSN --> Name


Customer(CID, CName, CAge, CMobile) 
Person(ANumber, Name, Age, Address)
100 --> Rahul
100 --> Riya 

100 --> 


-- what is dependency? 
It is the logical relation between two columns in a table. 


-- Funtional dependency:
A cell value in a row can uniquely determine the other cell values of the same row

employee_name --> Experience 
Chintan       --> 
Employee_ID --> Experience 
ID --> Name, Age, Address, Gender

-- Functional dependency 
A --> B If for the value of A there is a unique value of B
a1 --> b1
a1 --> b2
Here for the value of A as a1 we are not getting unique value of B 
as there two values of B as b1 and b2


Person(PID, PName, PAge)
1, Raj, 10
2, Riya, 20
3, Nita, 10
4, Rohit, 15

A   --> C
PID --> Age
1/a2   --> 10/c2
3/a3   --> 10/c2

1 --> 10
1 --> 20

4 --> 15
4 --> 20


-- Full Functional dependency 
Student(roll_num, Name, course_id, Subject, Grade)
xyz --> W

roll_num, course_id --> grade 
(1, CSE301) --> A
(1, CSE306) --> C
(2, CSE301) --> B
(2, CSE306) --> A
(3, CSE316) --> C



Roll_num, Subject --> Grade
(1, DBMS) --> A
(1, DS)   --> C
(2, DBMS) --> B
(2, DS)   --> A
(3, AI)   --> C
