# Join table , common id, intersect, inner join
SQL Methods for Common IDs Between Two Tables

INNER JOIN: Efficient for matching rows in both tables.
SELECT t1.ID FROM Table1 t1 INNER JOIN Table2 t2 ON t1.ID = t2.ID;

INTERSECT: Simplest for direct common values (if supported).
SELECT ID FROM Table1 INTERSECT SELECT ID FROM Table2;

WHERE EXISTS: Best for checking existence in large datasets.
SELECT ID FROM Table1 t1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Table2 t2 WHERE t1.ID = t2.ID);

Use INNER JOIN for detailed row info.
Use INTERSECT for direct common IDs.
Use WHERE EXISTS for existence checks in subqueries.
